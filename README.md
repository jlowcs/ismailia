Ismailia is a code coverage tool for ES6 using the [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) transpiler.

It's intention is to be used with [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) and [karma-coverage](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage), which provides code coverage reports using [istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul).

## Installation

For the moment, a custom fork of karma-coverage needs to be installed which supports ismailia is an instrumenter.

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev Spote/karma-coverage
```

Ismailia can be installed using

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev ismailia
```

## Usage

To use ismailia, set the [instrumenter](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage/blob/master/README.md#instrumenter) for the JavaScript file type to `ismailia`.

```json
coverageReporter: {
	instrumenter: {
		'**/*.js': 'ismailia'
	}
}
```

The scripts are compiled as [RequiredJS](http://requirejs.org/) modules. See the [example](https://github.com/Spote/ismailia/blob/master/example) directory for an example on how to setup tests. The example utilises the [karma-traceur-preprocessor](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-traceur-preprocessor) to compile the tests.
